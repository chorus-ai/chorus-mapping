# Non-EPIC Mappings

- This location will be used to share validated mappings of clinical terms to concepts in the OMOP vocabularies
- All mappings included in this directory have gone through a central validation process that requires a contribution to the [chorus-mapping-stage repository](https://github.com/chorus-ai/chorus-mapping-stage)
  - If you don't have access to this repository but would like to contribute to the mapping process, please contact a CHoRUS administrator
